# Orderfy

This project enables you the tracking of your data. Adding Users and Orders, and having data of successful transactions, new users and other things displayed in graphs.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can also run the project using `npm start` command.

To run the json-server, move to the src folder using `cd src` and run this command `npx json-server db.json`.
Make sure the json-server is running while the app is being used.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Additional info

Apart from using primeNG, and json-server, I used Metrial UI for Angular.
